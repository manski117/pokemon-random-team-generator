# Pokmeon Team Randomizer

This is a pokemon team randomizer. It is designed to generate a random team of gen9 legal pokemon and allow the user to export this team to [showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).

Currently it is only designed to work with generation 9 (Scarlet and Violet games). Eventually more generations and features will be added.

# TODO: 
## Create team slot components
- make sure each slot can randomize individually
- make sure they are aware of what the other pokemon will be
- send pokemon back to root state for export
- layout and styling

## Add Styling
- pokemon images (api call?)

## Program team-crafting logic

- auto-populate / auto complete inputs
- check validity
